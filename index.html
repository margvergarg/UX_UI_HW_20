                        <p>In my experience, I find it difficult to travel alone, especially when it comes to places I’ve never been to before. Something that has held me back from traveling more is that my friends don’t have the same availability or budget to travel that I do. On Tinder and Hinge, there are plenty of profiles that express interest in finding someone to travel with, so I wondered how an app like that might work, while still centering safety.</p>

                        <p>TrekMates was designed to safely pair individuals with similar interests and availability for group travel. We have observed that even though users had several things in common and got to know each other prior to the trip, they still felt awkward traveling together, which is causing them not to use our app for future trips. How might our application better match people so they have a better experience on their trips together?</p>

                <p>Looking back, it probably would have been easier if I had focused less on the onboarding process and more on the features of the app. I wish I could have let users interact with the home page more besides just swiping on proto profiles. I learned how deceptively time intensive wireframing can be, and that I shouldn’t be super precious about every detail when doing lo-fi prototypes. The design process can be a bit exhaustive, creating so many iterations, but I understand why reiterating is so important. Overall I’m proud of my work so far, and I wouldn’t mind pitching it to make it into a real app one day!</p>
